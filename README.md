## Description

The Windows Sockets Airport is a school project created to learn about windows sockets. The main idea of executing this project was creating a client side and a server side that communicates with each other.
In addition to developing our technical skills, we also improved our communication and got out of our comfort zone with communicating our obstacles encountered when developing and with the assignment of tasks.
